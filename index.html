    Looking In Depth: "Pride and Prejudice" By Jane Austen
    </h1>

    <h2>
    Jane Austen:
    </h2>
        <h4> Family Life: </h4>
            <p> Austen was born December 16, 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire, England. Out of her
eight siblings, she was the second daughter and seventh child. She belonged to the
                    middle class, which she boldly depicts in "Pride and Prejudice." </p>
        <h4> Society: </h4>
            <p> Austen focuses on early 19th century culture and manners in England, and how it affects the 
lives of everyday people. An interesting fact is neither her older sister, Cassandra nor Jane 
herself married. At the time period, this would have made life very difficult, considering
                the treatment of unmarried women. </p>
        <h4> Novels: </h4>
            <p> Luckily, her family provided a supportive environment for Austen to improvise her 
works, leading her to publish four novels in her lifetime: "Sense and Sensibility" 
(1811),"Pride and Prejudice" (1813), "Mansfield Park" (1814), and "Emma" (1815). Two 
novels were published posthumously, or after her death: "Persuasion" and "Northanger 
Abbey" (both 1817). </p>
        <h4> Love Life: </h4>
            <p> In 1802, Jane agreed to marry Harris Bigg-Wither, an heir of a Hampshire family, but changed 
her mind the next morning. It's also rumoured that she fell in love with someone who died 
               soon after. </p>
        <h4> Praise: </h4>
            <p> After 1811, she was in complete bliss. Her novels were published and widely read. They also
received great reviews. Critics praised her for her use of realism, which was a break from the
widely popular romantic melodramas. In fact, the Prince Regent (later George IV) enjoyed them so 
much that he kept copies in each of his residences. "Emma," was even "respectully dedicated" 
            to him. </p>
        <h4> Death: </h4> 
            <p> In January 1817, she began a new novel, "Sanditon," which was a mocking satire of the health 
resorts of the time. Ironically, her health started declining soon after, and she was taken to
Winchester to be looked at by an expert surgeon. Austen assumed she had biles, or a blockage
of her bile ducts, which help digest food. A modern examination, however, would determine she
was suffering from Addison's disease, which is a life-threatening condition that deals with 
insufficient amounts of hormone production. Austen died on July 18th, 1817, and was buried in
                Winchester Cathedral. </p>
