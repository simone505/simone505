    <h2> Jane Austen: </h2>
        <h4> Family Life: </h4>
            <p> Austen was born December 16, 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire, England. Out of her
eight siblings, she was the second daughter and seventh child. She belonged to the
                    middle class, which she boldly depicts in "Pride and Prejudice." </p>
        <h4> Society: </h4>
            <p> Austen focuses on early 19th century culture and manners in England, and how it affects the 
lives of everyday people. An interesting fact is neither her older sister, Cassandra nor Jane 
herself married. At the time period, this would have made life very difficult, considering
                the treatment of unmarried women. </p>
        <h4> Novels: </h4>
            <p> Luckily, her family provided a supportive environment for Austen to improvise her 
works, leading her to publish four novels in her lifetime: "Sense and Sensibility" 
(1811),"Pride and Prejudice" (1813), "Mansfield Park" (1814), and "Emma" (1815). Two 
novels were published posthumously, or after her death: "Persuasion" and "Northanger 
Abbey" (both 1817). </p>
        <h4> Love Life: </h4>
            <p> In 1802, Jane agreed to marry Harris Bigg-Wither, an heir of a Hampshire family, but changed 
her mind the next morning. It's also rumoured that she fell in love with someone who died 
               soon after. </p>
        <h4> Praise: </h4>
            <p> After 1811, she was in complete bliss. Her novels were published and widely read. They also
received great reviews. Critics praised her for her use of realism, which was a break from the
widely popular romantic melodramas. In fact, the Prince Regent (later George IV) enjoyed them so 
much that he kept copies in each of his residences. "Emma," was even "respectully dedicated" 
            to him. </p>
        <h4> Death: </h4> 
            <p> In January 1817, she began a new novel, "Sanditon," which was a mocking satire of the health 
resorts of the time. Ironically, her health started declining soon after, and she was taken to
Winchester to be looked at by an expert surgeon. Austen assumed she had biles, or a blockage
of her bile ducts, which help digest food. A modern examination, however, would determine she
was suffering from Addison's disease, which is a life-threatening condition that deals with 
insufficient amounts of hormone production. Austen died on July 18th, 1817, and was buried in
                Winchester Cathedral </p>
        <h2> Historical Context: </h2>
        <h4> "Transition Period:" </h4>
        <p> A year after Austen's birth, the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, marking the start of
the American Revolution. This was also followed by the French Revolution in 1789. The next two decades,
Britain was engaged with the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars from 1793-1815, one of the most 
important conflicts in England's history. Effects of this period were financial instability and monetary
volatility, or prices being able to change rapidly and unpredictably. When King George III when officially
insane, the regency began with his son, the Prince of Wales. He later became King George IV in 1820. He 
provided lots of support for the development of arts and sciences. Queen Victoria ruled after him, in 1837.
Sadly, a third of the population at this time lived on the edge of starvation, causing many riots. These 
riots also caused the practice of "machine breaking," or the attacking of new industrial machines. 
In "Pride and Prejudice," we also see a focus on the "changing social landscape" of the 18th century to late
19th century. We can also get a glimpse of the transition from the Enlightenment era to the Romantic era. </p>
        <h4> Gentry: </h4>
            <p> The Gentry was a social class that included those who owned land ("gentry") and professional classes, like
doctors, lawyers, and clergy (who did not own land). The most influential sector also happened to be the
                landed gentry. Austen belonged to this social class. </p>
            <h4> Gender Roles: </h4>
            <p> At the time period, instead of breaking up property and distributing it evenly amongst family members, it would 
go to the oldest male heir in the (extended) family. If a family had all daughters, the property would go to
a male. Women had to be dependent on men for livelihood, and thus marriage & courtship became a central focus
in their lives. Later on, they would become the means of accquiring more wealth in the family, though 
                "advantageuous marriages." </p>
        <h2> Chapters 1-61: </h2>
            <h5> Chapter 1: </h5>
                <ul> 
                    <li> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be 
                    in want of a wife." This quote demonstrates how getting married to a rich man was important for 
                    women, as they had to be financially dependent on the patriarchy at that time. </li>
                    <li> Mrs. Bennett wants one of her daughters to get married to Bingley, a <em>single</em>
                        young man who's <strong> WEALTHY </strong> (in Netherfield Park). </li>
                </ul>
            <h5> Chapter 2: </h5> 
                <ul> 
                    <li> Mrs. Bennett and her daughters are "competing" with Mrs. Long and her nieces for Bingley. </li>
                    <li> Mr. Bennett visits Bingley and does not tell anyone in the house about it. </li>
                    <li> When Mrs. Bennett finds out he met him, she's overjoyed and works on finding a proper time to invite 
                        him for dinner. </li>
                </ul>
            <h5> Chapter 3: </h5> 
                <ul>
                    <li> Mr. Bennett carefully dodges the ladies' questions about Bingley, so they ask their neighbor Lady Lucas </li>
                    <li> They find out he's "quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant
                        to be at the next assembly with a large party." This assembly is important because dacning is most likely
                    to occur, where the ladies have a chance to get accquainted with Bingley. </li>
                    <li> Mr. Bingley gets invited to dinner, but cannot attend because of "business." </li>
                    <li> Mr. Bingley (charming) is way better than Mr. Darcy (proud, arrogant) because of their qualities </li>
                    <li> Bingley was dancing with the eldest Bennett daughter (Jane) and seems to be attracted to her </li>
                    <li> Mr. Bennett seems to have a problem with Bingley; hoped that he would sprain his ankle in the first dance, 
                    just because he politely declined their dinner invite </li>
